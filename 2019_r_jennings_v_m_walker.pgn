{Introduction:  Anglia Avengers launched their 2018-19 4NCL season with a
rocket powered 3 out of 3 wins, only to crash to earth in the 4th round with a
resounding 1.5-6.5 defeat at the hands of our rival promotion contenders:
Spirit of Atticus. Round 5 was a closely fought match, with The Avengers left
trailing the lowly rated Bradford DCA Knights by 3-4, with only one game left
to play.  Was this the moment when a promising season was about to go
completely off the rails? But who should be representing The Avengers in that
game but our latest recruit: Martin Walker FM? It was an engrossing 70 move
game, with Paul, myself and most of the team watching with baited breath
Martin play out the final endgame sequence. Here is that critical debut game.
Annotations are by Martin (with supplementary remarks by Andy Lewis).} 1. g3 {
An opening with no name, since it is bound, sooner or later, to transpose into
something known. I have faced it once before - Oswald-Walker, British
Championship, Great Yarmouth 2007, Round 2(1-0)} g6 ({Probably better is the
more aggressive} 1... e5 {, as played against the same opponent by David
LeMoir, who won quite quickly.}) 2. Bg2 Bg7 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. O-O O-O 5. c4 d5 $1 {
Andy: From an amorphous opening, we're heading for an English Symmetrical. The
best chance for a White advantage is a rapid Pd4. Martin, however, heads this
off with a prophylactic ...d5 himself!} 6. cxd5 Nxd5 7. Nc3 c5 8. Nxd5 ({
It is a mistake to help the queen to develop. Better is} 8. Qb3 Nc7 9. d3 Nc6 {
, which resembles an English Opening.}) 8... Qxd5 9. d3 Nc6 10. Nd2 Qd7 11. Ne4
b6 12. Nc3 Bb7 13. Qa4 Rfd8 14. Be3 Rab8 ({At this point I completely froze
and thought for more than 40 minutes(!) - a very unusual experience - and,
unsurprisingly, didn't find a good move at the end. Better is} 14... Bxc3 15.
bxc3 Nd4 16. Qd1 Bxg2 17. Kxg2 Nf5 18. Bc1 ({Or} 18. Bd2 e5 {with a bind and
possibilities of play on both sides of the board.}) {Here was where I got
stuck and couldn't see how to proceed. But, in fact, after} 18... Rac8 {
, black is clearly better - he will soon play the (almost unstoppable) e5 and
torture white down the d-file. Black has more space, kingside attacking
chances, and is clearly better.}) 15. Rab1 a6 {This is a good move - more by
luck than judgment, I would have to say.} 16. Qh4 ({Not a good move. White's
best is the quiet, consolidating move} 16. Rbc1) ({I feared} 16. Qb3 {, but
completely without reason, since black is better after} Nd4 17. Bxd4 cxd4 18.
Ne4 ({Or} 18. Bxb7 dxc3 19. Bxa6 cxb2 20. Bb5 Qf5 {, when black's enormous
passed pawn at b2 gives him a clear edge.}) 18... Bd5 19. Qa3 Qb7 {. With the
bishop pair, more space and better prospects on both sides of the board, black
is clearly in the driving seat.}) 16... Nd4 17. Bxd4 Bxd4 ({Even better is} 
17... cxd4 18. Bxb7 (18. Ne4 f5 19. Nd2 ({Now} 19. Ng5 {achieves nothing.
White is in trouble after} h6 20. Nf3 g5 21. Qh5 Bd5 {. To release his queen,
white must play} 22. Nd2 {, when black can play} Bxa2 {, winning a pawn with
impunity.})) 18... dxc3 19. Bxa6 Ra8 20. Qc4 cxb2 {is much better for black,
as before. Black is better after the text, too, which I did not realise at the
time.}) 18. Bxb7 Rxb7 19. Ne4 {Now 20. Ng5 is a genuine threat.} Bg7 ({Better
is the more aggressive} 19... Kg7 {, when after} 20. e3 Bf6 21. Nxf6 exf6 22.
Rfd1 ({Not} 22. Qe4 f5 23. Qf3 Qd5 {, winning a pawn.}) 22... Qf5 23. d4 ({Or} 
23. Qc4 b5 24. Qe4 Qxe4 25. dxe4 Rbd7 {, when black dominates the only open
file and has a 3-2 majority on the queenside - if anything, black's advantage
is larger than the (-0.43) claimed by Rybka 4.}) 23... cxd4 24. exd4 Re7 {
, black is in charge and white has a grim defensive task ahead.}) 20. Ng5 ({
The computer doesn't like this move, which achieves essentially nothing. White
should combine attack and defence with} 20. Rfc1) 20... h6 21. Nf3 Qe6 22. b3
$2 ({To my utter astonishment, white blunders two pawns away. After} 22. Qe4
Qxe4 23. dxe4 c4 24. Kg2 b5 {, black is clearly better. Now he is winning.})
22... Qxe2 23. Kg2 Rxd3 24. Qf4 Qe6 ({Black's first sign of hesitation. I was
afraid of white's queen and two rooks getting near my king after} 24... Qxa2
25. Ne5 {. But this is nonsense. After} Bxe5 26. Qxe5 a5 27. h4 Qd2 28. h5 ({
After} 28. Rfd1 Qxd1 29. Rxd1 Rxd1 {, black will have no problem winning the
endgame - the WQ will be overwhelmed by the rooks and queenside pawns.}) 28...
Qg5 29. Qxg5 hxg5 30. hxg6 fxg6 {, the doubled g-pawns don't matter a jot -
black's queenside space invaders will soon touch down. I didn't realise at the
time how much trouble (and hard work) I was inviting.}) 25. Rbd1 Rbd7 {Black
is starting to lose his way. After} (25... g5 {, the WQ has no good moves and
after} 26. Qc4 Qxc4 27. bxc4 Rc3 {he is two pawns up and winning easily.}) 26.
Rfe1 Qf6 27. Rxd3 Rxd3 28. Qe4 Rd7 29. Qa8+ {Black is still winning but now it
is harder work.} Kh7 30. Qxa6 Qc6 31. Qc4 e6 32. Qe4 Qxe4 33. Rxe4 b5 {Here,
Rybka 4 is quite adamant - black is winning (-1.31).} 34. a4 $1 {Andy: The
best defensive try in a difficult position. White wants to liquidate the
Q-side Ps, after which the residual 4 v 3 majority on the K-side will not be
easy to exploit.} c4 35. bxc4 bxa4 36. c5 Ra7 37. Re2 Kg8 ({Black should play} 
37... a3 38. Ra2 Bf8 ({But not} 38... Bb2 39. Nd2 Rc7 40. Nc4 {, when white
should draw. Seeing this, I abandoned 37....a3 and played the much weaker text
move instead. Wrongly, it seems!}) 39. c6 Rc7 40. Ne5 ({Or} 40. Nd4 e5 41. Nf3
Bd6 42. Rc2 Ra7 43. Nd2 ({Or} 43. Ra2 Ra6 {, winning a second pawn and the
game.}) 43... a2 44. Nb3 Kg7 45. Rd2 Bc7 46. Rd7 Kf6 {. Once the BK reaches e6,
black will play Bb6-d4, when black's 2 queenside passed pawns will be far too
much for white to cope with.}) 40... Kg7 41. Rc2 f6 42. Nc4 Kf7 {. Once the BK
reaches c8 and stops the white c-pawn, the a-pawn will win the game for black.
If} 43. Rc1 {, aiming for Ra1 so white can win the a-pawn, then} e5 {is
important to give the BK a flight square.} 44. Ra1 Rxc6 45. Nxa3 Rc3 46. Nb5
Rc2 {and with Bc5 coming, black should win.}) 38. c6 a3 39. Ra2 Kf8 {The
resulting endgame is very tricky, but not impossible, for black to win. Rybka
4 agrees(-1.27) but anything computers say about endgames must be taken with a
large pinch of salt!} ({Andy: Black can try to hang onto to Pa3 with:} 39...
Bf8 {But sooner or later this seems to lead to the same type of 4 v 3 P ending
that we see in the game.} 40. Nd4 Rc7 41. Rc2 e5 42. Nb5 a2 43. Rxa2 Rxc6 $17)
40. c7 Rxc7 41. Rxa3 Rc2 $1 {Andy: A key move. The attack against Pf2 (and
latent threats against Ph2) considerably reduces White's defensive options.}
42. Ra7 Bf6 {Gradually aiming to get the bishop to the a7-g1 diagonal, which
it is difficult, if not impossible, for white to prevent.} 43. Ra8+ Kg7 44. Ra5
({This makes black's task slightly easier.} 44. Ra7 {is preferable.}) 44... Bd8
45. Rb5 Bc7 46. Ne5 Kf6 47. Ng4+ Kg7 48. Ne5 Bd6 49. Kf3 $6 ({Essential is} 49.
Nd3 $1 {, to keep the bishop out of c5.}) 49... Bc5 50. Nd3 ({Better is} 50.
Ng4 {, although after} f5 51. Ne3 Rc3 {, white's position looks distinctly
dodgy.}) 50... Bd4 51. Rb4 e5 52. Ke4 Re2+ 53. Kd5 ({Andy: The K march has to
continue!} 53. Kf3 $2 Rd2 54. Rb3 f5 $19) 53... Rd2 54. Rb3 {Andy: White's
defensive configuration looks bizarre - but yet there is no direct forced win
of material.} ({White cannot even play} 54. Ke4 {?? because of} f5+) 54... Bxf2
{Played after a long think - and, as it turns out, the best move. The problem
I could see was that I couldn't prevent Kf4 protecting his g-pawn, without
losing my mighty bishop. A highly technical ending resulted.} ({Andy:} 54... h5
$5 {is the alternative and also leads to a position with significant winning
chances for Black.}) 55. Kxe5 g5 $6 ({The only way of preventing Kf4 - but not
a good move. After} 55... Re2+ 56. Kf4 Bd4 57. h3 f5 58. Kf3 Re3+ 59. Kg2 Kf6 {
, white is in some sort of straitjacket, although making progress will still
not be easy. But this way black keeps his bishop, which is clearly superior to
white's knight.}) 56. Nxf2 $2 ({Andy: White should have seized his one chance
to return his K to defend his Ps with:} 56. Kf5 $1 $15) 56... Rxf2 {[#] Andy:
"A little knowledge is a dangerous thing" - or so the saying goes. A general
rule governing R endgames is that 3 v 2 P on the same side of the board is a
draw. But here the rule would only apply if the White K could safely return to
shepherd his Ps. Alas, the White K is cutoff from the defense along the f-file.
Martin envisioned this position when opting for the exchange of minor pieces,
and had correctly assessed the position as (if not yet a theoretical win)
highly promising for Black.} 57. h3 h5 58. Ra3 ({Andy: My first thoughts on
glancing at this position is that White should try to stabilize the
P-structure with:} 58. g4 $6 {But this loses in instructive fashion.} hxg4 (
58... h4 $143 $2 $15 {jettisons most of Black's advantage, as the plan of ...
Rf2-g3 is met with Ke4 & Rf3.}) 59. hxg4 f6+ 60. Ke6 (60. Ke4 $2 Rf4+ {wins
Pg4.}) 60... Rf4 61. Rg3 Kg6 62. Rg1 f5 $1 63. gxf5+ Rxf5 $19 64. Rg3 Ra5 65.
Rg1 Ra4 66. Ke5 g4 $19 {easily winning as the White K is cutoff on the 4th
rank.}) 58... f6+ 59. Ke4 g4 $6 ({A mistake. After} 59... Kg6 60. Rb3 Rh2 $1
61. g4 hxg4 62. hxg4 Rh4 63. Rg3 f5+ 64. Kf3 (64. Ke5 Rxg4 {! wins}) 64... f4
65. Rg2 Rh3+ 66. Kf2 Ra3 67. Rg1 Kf6 68. Rc1 Rg3 {, black will win the white
g-pawn and the game.}) 60. h4 $5 {Andy: The team discussed this endgame
extensively at the dinner after the match, and the initial consensus was that
this was an obvious mistake and probably the losing move. The defender, surely,
should aim to exchange Ps, and Ph4 presents an additional target for the R.
However, matters are not so simple!} ({Andy: The obvious move:} 60. hxg4 $1 {
turns out to be the correct one!} hxg4 61. Rb3 Kg6 62. Ra3 Kg5 63. Rb3 f5+ {
And now the ultra precise:} 64. Kd4 $1 {saves the day!} ({As Martin says:} 64.
Ke5 Rf3 $19 {black wins the g-P.}) 64... f4 (64... Rf3 65. Rxf3 gxf3 66. Ke3

Re2+ 63. Kd5 $2 {A very serious mistake, allowing the black king to shelter
from checks by the rook behind the white king. Maybe tiredness was starting to
become a factor, since we had been playing for more than 5 hours.} ({Andy: A
truly horrible trap to fall into would be:} 63. Kf4 $4 Re4#) ({However, White
can still hold the draw after:} 63. Kd4 $1 Kf6 ({If} 63... f4 {, then after}
64. Rb6+ Kf7 65. gxf4 Rh2 66. Ke5 Rxh4 ({Likewise after} 66... g3 67. Rf6+ Kg7
68. Rf5 {, white should hold.}) 67. Rb7+ Ke8 ({Or} 67... Kg6 68. f5+ Kg5 69.

{, black can continue to play for a while, but there seems to be no way to
make progress.}) 63... f4 64. gxf4 Kf5 {Now white cannot simultaneously defend
the f-pawn and stop the black g-pawn. The game is won for black.} 65. Rb8 Kxf4
66. Rh8 g3 ({Of course I realised that} 66... Re5+ 67. Kd4 g3 {won easily, but
I calculated that the text also won, and slightly more quickly. After about 5
hours and 30 minutes play, I wanted to end the game as quickly as reasonably
possible.}) 67. Rxh5 g2 68. Rg5 Kf3 69. h5 Kf2 70. Rf5+ Kg3 {The point is that
the white king will be far too far away from the h-pawn to enable it to
promote, or even save it.} 71. Rg5+ Kh2 72. h6 g1=Q 73. Rh5+ Kg2 74. h7 Qd1+ {
Mate follows, so white resigned(0-1).  Epilogue: Heartened by our "edge of our
finger-tips" survival in Round 7, we faced Manchester Manticores for our
Sunday 8th Round: on a paper, at least, a distinctly tougher prospect. In a
tight match, we led 4-3 with one game to finish.  And who was our player in
that game? Yes, you've guess it! Martin Walker wrapped up yet another
successful R endgame to win us the match 5-3. A great debut for Martin! And a
great weekend for Anglia Avengers who have already qualified for the promotion
pool for the Division 2 play offs!} 0-1

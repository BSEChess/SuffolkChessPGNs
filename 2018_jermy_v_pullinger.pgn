1. d4 e6 2. Nf3 b6 {[JJ] Last time we played each other we had the same
Queen's Indian opening.} 3. Bf4 (3. e4 Bb7 4. Bd3 c5 5. c3 Nf6 6. Qe2 Be7 7.
O-O {is the most popular continuation for White, but Black has achieved some
good results with 7...d5!?}) 3... Bb7 4. Nbd2 f5 (4... d6 5. e3 Nd7 6. Bd3 h6
7. c3 Ngf6 {was played in the game Radjabov,T (2784)-McShane,L (2706) Moscow
2012. Here e4 followed by h3, would have given White control of the centre and
the dark-squared bishop a safe haven.}) 5. e3 Nf6 6. Bd3 Be7 7. O-O O-O 8. c4
$6 {[JJ] Last time we played I played c3, but this time I wanted to go for a
more aggressive approach.} (8. c3 Nh5 9. Be5 $5 d6 10. Bf4 {now if} Nxf4 11.
exf4 {[%csl Ge6] Black's e6 pawn is weak.}) 8... Nh5 $1 9. h3 $6 {[JJ] I saw a
chess Grandmaster talking about the London System on a YouTube video, who
explained that the resulting pawn structure was ok and gives White control of
e5.} Nxf4 (9... Nc6) 10. exf4 Na6 $5 {[JJ] I was quite surprised by this move.
I was expecting Nc6 or even c5.} (10... c5 11. d5 exd5 12. cxd5 Bxd5 13. Bc4
Bxc4 14. Nxc4 d5 15. Nce5 $44) (10... Nc6 11. d5 $11) 11. Qb3 c5 12. d5 Nb4 {
[JJ] I saw a tactical attack because his king was on the weak light square
diagonal.} 13. Rfe1 $6 ({Preserving remaining bishop was best.} 13. Be2 exd5
14. a3 {a nice intermezzo.} Na6 15. cxd5 $14) 13... exd5 $6 (13... Nxd3 14.
Qxd3 Bf6 $15 {Black's bishop pair are ready to pounce.}) 14. cxd5 Bxd5 15. Bc4
Bxc4 16. Nxc4 d5 17. Rad1 {[JJ] I felt like I had rapid development.} Qc7 $2 ({
A much stronger move for Black would have been} 17... b5 $1 {resulting in a
bizarre and unclear position!} 18. Ne3 c4 19. Qc3 $13) 18. Nce5 Kh8 $4 (18...
c4 19. Qa4 $14) 19. a3 c4 20. Qa4 $2 ({Even better was} 20. Qc3 $1 $18 {
now the knight has to retreat (20...Nd3 loses a whole piece.) and White's
pieces run rampage.}) 20... Nd3 21. Nxd3 cxd3 22. Rxd3 {[JJ] I felt like I was
in a winning position.} Qc4 23. Rd4 ({The computer finds a nice way to
maintain an advantage, although it's almost impossible for a human to foresee
that the resulting endgame favours White.} 23. Qd1 $1 Bf6 24. Qd2 Bxb2 25. Ne5
$1 Bxe5 26. fxe5 $16 {Despite being a pawn down, White's approximately +1 due
to good piece coordination and more importantly an extremely dangerous passed
e-pawn.}) 23... Qxa4 24. Rxa4 Bf6 25. Ne5 $1 {Jaden plays an excellent knight
move. Normally bishops are better than knights in open positions, but this
situation is different as White's knight is commanding the centre of the board.
If the bishop trades itself for the knight, then White effectively gains an
extra (passed) pawn.} Rfc8 26. b3 {It would have been better to improve the
position of the e-rook.} (26. Rd1 Rc2 27. b4 $16 {and Black has to concede
either the a or d pawn.}) 26... Rc7 27. Rd4 Rd8 28. Red1 g5 $2 {28...Kg8 would
have been a much calmer approach for Black. Jaden now shows his raw talent by
playing the endgame very naturally. Note how all of his pawns end up on
light-squares so that Black's bishop becomes frustrated that it can't gobble
any up.} 29. Rxd5 Rxd5 30. Rxd5 gxf4 31. Nc4 Rc5 32. Rxc5 bxc5 33. Nd6 Bb2 34.

[JJ] At this point I had 29 mins on my clock and my opponent had 4 mins.} Bh4

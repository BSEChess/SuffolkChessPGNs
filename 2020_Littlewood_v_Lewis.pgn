1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 g6 3. Nc3 Bg7 4. e4 d6 5. Nf3 O-O 6. Be2 {Paul has played this
variation against the K.I.D, the most straightforward and IMHO the strongest,
throughout his career.} e5 7. O-O (7. d5 Na6 $5 8. Bg5 h6 9. Bh4 g5 10. Bg3 Nh5
{was the continuation from an earlier game against Paul in the mid 1990s, and
led to a draw around move 20.}) 7... Nc6 8. d5 Ne7 9. Bg5 {Not quite what I
was expecting - a new move from Paul!} ({The line I was anticipating was:} 9.
Ne1 Nd7 10. Nd3 f5 11. Bd2 Nf6 12. f3 Kh8 13. Rc1 c6 {Littlewood,P (2361)-Nunn,
J (2581) BCF-ch Seniors 50 2017 (7) 1/2-1/2}) 9... Kh8 $6 {A move which
somehow I thought I had played before: but I hadn't!} ({White is hoping for
the routine:} 9... h6 10. Bxf6 Bxf6 {when:} 11. b4 Bg7 12. c5 {when White's
Q-side initiative is starting to look promising, and the lack of the
dark-squared B is no big deal.}) ({The game I had actually played in this line
continued:} 9... Nh5 $5 10. Ne1 Nf4 11. Nd3 Nxe2+ 12. Qxe2 h6 13. Be3 g5 14. f3
Ng6 15. c5 Nf4 16. Qd2 f5 17. Nxf4 gxf4 18. Bf2 Rf7 19. Rfd1 Bf8 $14 {Marsden,
L-Lewis,A Essex Team QP SF: Ilford v Wanstead 2010 (1) 0-1}) 10. Nd2 Nfg8 11.
b4 f5 12. c5 $5 $146 {White attempts to take full advantage of Black's
ponderous K-side manoeuvring to launch an immediate (and dangerous) attack on
the Q-side.} ({More circumspect (and also critical) is:} 12. f3 {retaining the
dark-squared B: eg.} Bh6 13. Bh4 g5 14. Bf2 g4 15. fxg4 fxg4 16. g3 $14 {
Gonda,L (2482)-Pirisi,G (2246) Balaton op Heviz 2010 (3) 1-0} (16. c5 $1 $16))
12... h6 13. Bxe7 $8 (13. Bh4 $4 g5 14. Bg3 f4 $19) 13... Qxe7 14. cxd6 ({
White should defer the capture on d6 for at least one move.} 14. Rc1 dxc5 $141
15. bxc5 Qxc5 16. Nb5 $16 {looks horrible.}) 14... cxd6 15. Rc1 {White has
announced his intention of playing Nb5 followed by either Nc7 or Rc7. Both of
these ideas look worrying and I was really unclear as to whether I should try
to stop this or seek counterplay elsewhere.} Nf6 $1 {Better than trying to
defend the c7 square!} (15... a6 $143 $2 16. Nc4 Qd8 17. a4 $16 {and White
will get a permanent bind on the Q-side with Pa5 & Nb6.}) (15... Bd7 16. Nb5
Bxb5 17. Bxb5 $14 {It's marginal, but only White can be better in this
situation. White has developed his Q-side play and the Black K-side
counterattack will not count for much.}) 16. Nb5 {A quintessential K.I.D
situation: Black either is in deep trouble or is basically OK. Which of these
was the case was not yet known to the players - and certainly not to me!} (16.
Bd3 {was an alternative idea to avoid gambiting Pe4.}) 16... fxe4 $1 {It's
good to retain the N! Nf6 is useful to pressurize Pd5. Also after White plays
Nc7-e6, Black can play ...Be6 and then ...Pd5 will be supported by Nf6.} (16...
Nxe4 17. Nxe4 fxe4 {is a worse way to grab Pe4.}) ({Better than the passive:} 
16... Ne8 $2 17. a4 $14 (17. Nxa7 $143 Rxa7 18. Rxc8 Rxa2 $11)) 17. Nc7 {
Normally when the N reaches this square in the K.I.D. this spells trouble for
Black. But here Ne6 is not much of a threat - Black is well placed to take on
e6 and can either pick up Pe6 or take the centre with ...Pd5.} (17. Rc7 $4 Qd8
$17 {White cannot meet the twin threats of ...Pa6 & ...Nxd5.}) 17... Rb8 18.
Qa4 h5 ({It doesn't pay to be too greedy in the K.I.D!} 18... a6 19. b5 {
keeps it interesting for White.}) 19. Qxa7 Bf5 {All that White's Q-side
initiative has achieved is to exchange his vital Pe4 for the not very useful
Pa7! It's extremely hard to find a sensible plan for White.} 20. Qb6 (20. Na6
$4 Ra8 $19) 20... Bh6 21. Rcd1 {White's position is on the precipice - just
one good shove will topple him. I thought I had found it!} Rbc8 22. Nb5 Nxd5
23. Qxd6 Qxd6 24. Nxd6 Nc3 25. Nxc8 {The only way to avoid losing an entire
piece.} (25. Bb5 Nxd1 26. Nxc8 Rxc8 27. Rxd1 Rd8 $19) 25... Nxe2+ 26. Kh1 Rxc8
27. Nb3 {So far I had played the game reasonably briskly - but now I used
almost half of my remaining 20 minutes. 2Bs v R should be a winning advantage
- but there is no clear and obvious winning plan.} h4 {Finally, a K-side
attack. ...Ph3 is an annoying move to meet and if White prevents it with Ph3, .
..Pe3 opens the g3 square for Ne2.} 28. Rfe1 Rc2 29. Rd8+ Kg7 30. Rb8 h3 31.
Rxb7+ Kf6 32. Nc5 (32. Rb6+ $5 {would give Black a difficult choice. It's
really hard to know whether g5 or e7 is the correct square for the K.}) 32...
hxg2+ 33. Kxg2 Nf4+ 34. Kf1 {Seemingly the only defense. I had found decent
continuations against other K moves. But now I am down to less that a couple
of minutes. Sometimes having a completely won position isn't so much help,
when the position is still complex and you have almost run out of time!} (34.
Kg1 $143 Nh3+ 35. Kh1 Nxf2+ 36. Kg1 e3 $19) (34. Kh1 $143 Nd3 35. Nxd3 exd3 $19

37. Kg1 Rxe1#) 35... Nd5 36. Re2 {Paul continues to find a challenging defense.

Ke6 37. Nc5+ Kd6 38. Rb6+ Kc7 39. Rb7+ Kc6 $19 {White is out of checks.}) 36...
Nxe3+ 37. Ke1 ({A better defense is:} 37. Kf2 $142 {but Black can pick up the
h-P and retain his initiative.} Ng4+ 38. Kf3 (38. Ke1 $4 Rc1#) 38... Nxh2+ 39.
Kf2 Ng4+ 40. Kf3 (40. Kf1 Rc1+ 41. Kg2 Ne3+ $19) 40... Rc3+ 41. Kg2 Ne3+ 42.
Kf2 e4 $19 {Black's extra minor-pieces are combining with the passed-P, and
Black has retained his active R. Black should win from here.}) 37... Rc1+ 38.
Kf2 ({I was looking forwards to:} 38. Kd2 Nc4#) 38... Rf1+ 39. Kg3 {I was sure
that there must be a forced mate in this position, and I thought for almost
all of my final minute looking for it. I couldn't find it and decide to repeat
a couple of times. But, as I saw my seconds ticking down I miss-keyed my move
and almost lost on time.} Bf4+ 40. Kh4 Bg5+ {Played to gain time on the clock
and earn some precious thinking time.} 41. Kg3 Bf4+ 42. Kh4 g5+ 43. Kh5 Bg4+ {
I was relieved to find an obvious win of a R - but missed an even stronger
continuation.} ({It would be churlish to point out, that I missed not one but
three mates in 2!} 43... Bg6+ 44. Kh6 g4# (44... Nf5#) (44... Ng4#)) 44. Kh6
Bxe2 45. h3 Rh1 46. Ne4+ Kf5 47. Nf2 Rh2 {3 pieces down - it's well passed
time to throw the towel in!} 0-1

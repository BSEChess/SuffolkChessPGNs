move is not well regarded in two recent books which I own on the English
Opening (Zenon Franco 2006 & Carsten Hansen 2018). Following the game, I am
less sure about this assessment.} 11. exf3 cxd4 $5 {A pragmatic decision.
Black contents himself with only a small structural advantage in return for
the 2Bs. But on the other hand, side-steps potential space-stealing options
for White involving Pd5.} (11... O-O 12. d5 $5 $36) 12. cxd4 O-O 13. f4 Nc6 14.
Be3 (14. d5 {is less dangerous after the exchange ...c5xd4, as Black will have
ample counterplay against Pc4: eg.} Na5 15. Bd2 Rc8 16. Bxa5 bxa5 17. Rb1 Bc5

Bb4 {leaves the White Rs misplaced.}) 16... Bb4 17. Re2 Be7 {The unusual B
"shimmy" (...Be7-a3-b4-a3) hasn't gained much for Black - but hasn't lost much
either!} 18. Qa4 Qc7 19. Rc2 Na5 20. Rcc1 (20. Rbc1 Qc6 {forces the exchange
of Qs.}) 20... Rfd8 21. h4 $5 (21. c5 $5) 21... Qc6 22. Qd1 d5 {A nicely timed
P-advance. If ...d5 had been played without adequate preparation, it would
have allowed the destabilizing Pf5. And yet the "improvement" in Black's
structural advantage, only serves to increase the power of White's 2Bs.} 23.
cxd5 $6 (23. c5 $142 bxc5 24. dxc5 $14) 23... Qxd5 {[#] It is hard to believe
that the beleagured Pd4 is going to win the game for White in 10 moves times -
yet this is precisely what happens!} 24. Qa4 g6 25. Rb5 Qd6 26. Rxc8 Rxc8 27.
f5 $5 {Described as a "creative" move in the post-match debrief in the Asia
Tandoori. Perhaps the 2 bottles of wine improved my team-mates perception of
this idea!} exf5 (27... gxf5 {gives White obvious compensation for the P by
way of the weakened Black K-side: eg.} 28. d5 e5 29. Bd3 $44) 28. Bf4 Qa3 $6 (

$18 {Most players would resign at this point: so why is White playing on?
Perhaps because in our previous game (in 2007) I had played on in a hopeless
endgame for 30 moves. If so, I was more than happy to give him his revenge!}
Rxc7 36. Bxc7 Bc5 37. Bb8 Kf8 38. Bxa7 Ke7 39. Bb8 f6 {Even in an utterly won
position, one should still guard against complacency. Here, I could envision a
position after ...h6 & ...g5 in which the B is entombed on b8. Even then,
White should still be able to win: but better to play a move which ensures the
win is trivial.} 40. Bf4 Kd8 41. Bc4 Be7 42. Be3 Kc7 43. Bg8 Z0 {Black
resigned.} (43... h5 44. Bf7 {wins at least 2Ps.}) 1-0

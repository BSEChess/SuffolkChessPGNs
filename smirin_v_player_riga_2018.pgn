Variation.} 4. a3 {Now I was out of theory. However, I'd briefly looked at

Qc5 first kind of wastes White's time as they must retreat their Queen in
order to keep the game more interesting, which in turn blocks the development
of the queenside rook.}) 10. Qb1 (10. Qxc5 Bxc5 $11 {creates no immediate

never managed to achieve a result against a 2600+ player before, so I accepted
after a little consideration about the position which I thought was ever so
slightly better for Black. In fact, Black could try and press for a long time,
but unlike in my first round game when I decided to go for a win, I was short
on time (15 minutes v roughly 1 hour). Therefore my decision was made.} 1/2-1/2

1. d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 g6 3. c4 Bg7 4. Nc3 O-O 5. e4 d6 6. Be2 Na6 {A reasonable
alternative to the stereo-typed 6...e5. Panagiotis is a specialist in this line.
} 7. h3 $5 {An unusual move order. The Makogonov Variation (or 6. Ph3) is more commonly
seen in combination with an early Be3 rather than Be2.} e5 8. d5 Nc5 $5 ({
Black's unusual move order has bourne immediate fruits. He has an
unproblematic equality with:} 8... Nh5 $1 9. g3 (9. Nh2 Nf4 10. Bf3 Nc5 $15)
9... f5 10. exf5 gxf5 11. Bg5 Nf6 $11 {Bachmann,A (2644)-Giri,A (2745)
Olympiad-41 Tromsoe 2014 (11.1) 0-1}) 9. Qc2 a5 10. Be3 b6 11. Nd2 Bd7 12. g4
a4 13. Nf1 {The KID is a tough gig! A lot of experience is required to
understand that this seemingly natural N move throws away most of White's
advantage. Rather than ...Pf5, Black is aiming for Q-side play with ...Pc6, ...
cxd5 and an eventual ...Pb5. To hold up Black's counterplay, Nd2 needs to be
on the Q-side, either to go to c4 or (via b1 & a3) to b5.} (13. O-O-O $142 c6
14. g5 Ne8 15. h4 $14) 13... c6 14. Ng3 {The move holds up ...Pf5 - which
Black does not have the least intention of playing!} cxd5 15. cxd5 Ra5 $5 {
An interesting approach to forcing P...b5.} (15... Qb8 $11 {has a similar
intention.}) 16. O-O b5 17. Rfc1 $6 ({White does better to challenge Black's
Q-side initiative with:} 17. b4 $142 axb3 18. axb3 b4 19. Na4 Bxa4 20. bxa4 b3
21. Qb1 $11) 17... b4 18. Nd1 Qb8 ({Even better is:} 18... b3 $142 $17 {
forcing the creation of a target: Pb2.}) 19. Qb1 Rc8 {White's opening strategy
has been a fiasco. Black has an initiative on the Q-side, and White's K-side
P-advances have only created weakness in White's position!} 20. f3 Ne8 {
Not with the intention of ...Pf5. The N is heading for d4.} 21. Nf2 Bf6 22. Nf1
Nc7 23. Nd2 Nb5 24. Kg2 Ra8 ({There is nothing wrong with the immediate:} 24...
Nd4 $15) 25. Nc4 $6 (25. Nd3 $142 Nd4 26. Nxc5 dxc5 27. Bd3 $11) 25... Nd4 $15
{When a Black N reaches this square in the K.I.D. without material loss - it's
a sign that something has gone seriously wrong for White!} 26. Bf1 b3 27. Bxd4
({It is impossible to lock up the Q-side with:} 27. a3 Nc2 $19 {wins the
exchange.}) 27... bxa2 {Natural enough: ensuring that Pb2 is a fixed target.} (
{Equally good was:} 27... exd4 28. a3 Bb5 $19 29. Z0 $140 Bg5) 28. Rxa2 exd4 {
Again, when in the K.I.D, White needs to give up his dark-squared-B to capture
a N on d4, it's generally a sign that the game is proceeding in Black's favour.
} 29. b4 {A bid for freedom - which just losses the b-P!} (29. Z0 $140 Nb3 $19
{leaving Ra2 stranded.}) 29... Nb3 (29... axb3 $143 30. Rxa8 Qxa8 31. Nb6 $44)
30. Rcc2 Qxb4 $19 {Black has a won position, with an extra-P, the 2-Bs, and an
active postion. It's just a shame he has almost no time left!} 31. Nd3 Qb8 32.
f4 $5 {A brave move. With passive moves, White has no realistic chance of
holding the position. With Pf4 he at least asserts the one positive aspect of
his position: his K-side majority.} Bg7 33. Qe1 (33. g5 $5 Bb5 $19) 33... Bb5
34. Nb4 Bxc4 $6 {Giving up part of his advantage: Black does better to
preserve the pressure on Nc4.} (34... Re8 $19) (34... Nc5 $19) 35. Bxc4 Nc5 36.
Nc6 Qc7 (36... Qb7 $5) 37. Rd2 Re8 38. Re2 a3 39. Kf3 {After achieving my own 
(fortuitious) victory in R1, this is the point at which I started watching the
game. The conclusion was a thriller, both players have less than 2 minutes on
the clock.} Qb7 ({A standard idea to achieve black-square domination is:} 39...
g5 $5 {and after:} 40. fxg5 (40. e5 gxf4 41. e6 {does not work as Nc6 is en
pris.} fxe6 $17) 40... Nd7 {only Black can be better.}) 40. e5 {Another brave
move, but unless White asserts his central-majority, he just has a bad
position.} (40. Z0 $140 Ra4 {is an awkward threat to meet.}) 40... dxe5 (40...
Ra4 $143 41. exd6 Rxe2 42. Qxe2 {gives White better defensive resources.}) 41.
fxe5 Ra4 42. Qc1 d3 43. Re1 Nd7 $5 {Even with a won position, it is still
difficult to see a way through to the win in such a complex position.} ({
With the benefit of more time, it's easy to see that:} 43... d2 $1 44. Rxd2 Bh6
$19 {is an easily won position.}) 44. Qc3 Nxe5+ 45. Nxe5 Rxe5 $5 ({The
accurate move order was:} 45... d2 $1 46. Rxd2 Rxe5 47. Rxe5 Bxe5 48. Qxe5 Rxc4
$19 {preserving the powerful Pa3.}) 46. Rxe5 Bxe5 47. Qxe5 (47. Qxd3 Qb4 48.

Rxb3 d1=Q+ $19) 50... Kg7 51. Qe5+ Kf8 $1 52. Qh8+ Ke7 53. Qe5+ Kd7 $19 {
White has run out of checks!}) 50. Rxd1 Qb3+ 51. Kf2 $4 {Finally, White cracks:
the combination of a long-game, a fast time-limit and the need to continuous
calculate Black's tactical threats.} ({During the game, I wasn't sure at all
how Black would proceed after the more testing:} 51. Ke2 {Black is better -
due to the exposed White K but there is no immediate forced checkmate sequence,
and the passed Pd5 presents some dangers for Black. I suspect the game would
end up in a draw.} {The seemingly overwhelming:} Qc2+ (51... Qxh3 52. Qe8+ Kg7
53. Qe5+ f6 54. Qe7+ Kh6 (54... Kg8 55. Qe8+ {etc.}) 55. Qe3+ Qxe3+ 56. Kxe3
Kg5 57. d6 Rc8 58. Kd4 Kxg4 59. Rg1+ $13 {is an interesting endgame to analyse.
}) (51... Qb4 $5 $40) 52. Rd2 Re4+ {Leads to a tenable endgame after:} 53. Kf3
$1 Rxe5 54. Rxc2 Rxd5 $15) 51... Qxd1 (51... Rc2+ 52. Kg1 Qxh3 53. Qe8+ Kg7 54.
Qe5+ f6 55. Qe7+ Kh6 56. Qf8+ Kg5 $19) 52. Qe8+ {Notwithstanding appearances,
the White-Q cannot deliver a perpetual check.} Kg7 53. Qe5+ f6 ({Equally good
is:} 53... Kh6 54. g5+ (54. Qe3+ g5 55. Qb6+ Kg7 56. Qb2+ Qd4+ $19) 54... Kh5
$19) 54. Qe7+ Kh6 55. Qf8+ Kg5 56. h4+ Kxg4 57. Qc8+ $6 {A joke move. But many
blitz games have been salvaged by such knavery!} Rxc8 0-1
